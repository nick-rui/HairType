# Models for Hair Parameter Prediction  

## Overview  
In video games and virtual 3D environments, replicating realistic hair—especially curly hair—remains a significant challenge. Traditional rendering techniques often fall short, leading to inaccuracies that can misrepresent certain ethnic minority groups. This project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict detailed hair parameters, enabling more accurate rendering of diverse hair types and curl patterns in virtual settings.  

## Motivation  
- **Realism in Virtual Environments:**  
  Realistic hair rendering is key to immersive gameplay and believable digital avatars. Current methods struggle with the complexity of curly hair, often resulting in generic or stereotyped representations.  

- **Inclusivity and Representation:**  
  By improving hair parameter prediction, we aim to ensure that virtual representations honor the diversity of hair types, particularly those of ethnic minority groups. This contributes to fairer and more inclusive digital content.  

- **Technical Innovation:**  
  This project explores advanced CNN architectures and techniques to address a nuanced problem in computer graphics and AI, bridging the gap between deep learning and realistic hair simulation.  

## Problem Statement  
Rendering hair, especially curly hair, in 3D environments poses unique challenges due to its complex structure and variability. Traditional methods may fail to capture subtle details like curl tightness, frizz, and flow, leading to:  
- Inaccurate representations that detract from user immersion.  
- Misrepresentation of hair characteristics in ethnic minority groups.  
- Increased workload for artists trying to manually correct or enhance generated hair models.  

## Approach  
Our solution is to experiment with CNN models to predict hair parameters from input images. Key elements of our approach include:  

### Data Collection & Preprocessing  
- Gather diverse datasets covering a wide range of hair types and curl patterns.  
- Annotate the data with key hair parameters (e.g., curl type, density, direction, frizz).  
- Extract masked images and high-contrast hair patches and determine which type of data a model would best train on.

### CNN Architecture  
- Design and train convolutional neural networks tailored for hair parameter extraction.  
- Experiment with various architectures (e.g., ResNet, U-Net variations) to optimize performance.  
- Incorporate data augmentation techniques to improve generalization across different hair types.  

### Training & Evaluation  
- Use loss functions that balance parameter accuracy and visual quality.  
- Validate models using both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.  
- Iteratively refine the model based on performance feedback.  

## Results  
While work is in progress, early experiments have shown promising results in capturing key hair attributes. Our models are able to:  
- Differentiate between various curl types with a high degree of accuracy.  
- Generalize well across diverse datasets, reducing bias in hair representation.  
- Provide a robust foundation for integrating into rendering pipelines for real-time applications.
